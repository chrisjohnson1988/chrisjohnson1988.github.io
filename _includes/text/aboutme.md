# About me

I am a highly skilled full stack developer working for the [Centre of Ecology and Hydrology][1] Lancaster.

I am passionate about creating elegant and maintainable code. To this end I have hosted best practice tutorials, which have been very well attended by developers from CEHâ€™s sister organisations. They have received very positive feedback and been excellent for knowledge transfer and personal development of attendees.
